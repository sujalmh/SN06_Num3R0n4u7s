# It's all "@"

### File: confusing.txt

## Solution:

It looks like a QR code, but the QR format is wrong. Text editors are not able to render the characters correctly.

1. Open the file in terminal, the QR looks fine.
![terminal.png](./terminal.png)

3. Editing confusing.txt according to the output in the terminal
4. Replacing "@" with "â–ˆ"
![qr.png](./qr.png)

6. Parsing QR gives the flag

### Flag: sudo{a5c11_roCk5}
