# Birthday Message

Darish decided to play a little birthday prank on Lalit, gifting him an audio file as a present. But Lalit's convinced there's a secret twist hidden in it. Can you be Lalit's partner-in-crime to unravel this audio enigma?

### File: audio.wav

## Solution

1. Opening audio file using audacity.
2. It is binary encoded, the highs being 1 and lows being 0.
3. Using python to get the binary string.
```python
from scipy.io import wavfile
import numpy as np

#convert bits to ascii
def b2a(b):
     return ''.join(chr(int(''.join(x), 2)) for x in zip(*[iter(b)]*8))
 
# Load the WAV file
input_file = 'audio.wav'
output_file = 'binary_output.wav'

# Read the WAV file
sample_rate, audio_data = wavfile.read(input_file)

# Apply Binarization
threshold = 0  # Adjust this value based on your audio characteristics
binary_audio = list((audio_data > threshold).astype(np.int16))

# Save the binary audio to a new WAV file
bin=[str(i) for i in binary_audio]
out=''.join(bin)
print(b2a(out))
```
Output: 
```
flag = "sudo{binary-it-is}"
print(flag)
```

### Flag: sudo{binary-it-is}

---

# It's all "@"

### File: confusing.txt

## Solution:

It looks like a QR code, but the QR format is wrong. Text editors are not able to render the characters correctly.

1. Open the file in terminal, the QR looks fine.

3. Editing confusing.txt according to the output in the terminal
4. Replacing "@" with "â–ˆ"

</p>

6. Parsing QR gives the flag

### Flag: sudo{a5c11_roCk5}
