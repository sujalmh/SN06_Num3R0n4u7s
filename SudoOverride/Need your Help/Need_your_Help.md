User `swapnilcrushes` wants to merge with his love interest. Can you help him do so by finding the flag?

## Solution:

1. Using a username search engine to find account related to `swapnilcrushes`.
2. A [github account](https://github.com/swapnilcrushes) is found.
3. Checking commits of the [repository](https://github.com/swapnilcrushes/this-is-my-repo), deleted files are discovered.
4. [this-is-my-repo/.bashrc](https://github.com/swapnilcrushes/this-is-my-repo/blob/72fb0854c987b7491b9523879e73cb88e7e5fc16/.bashrc) contains command `wget https://cantsee.sudooverride.tech/part3.sudo`, which gives an incomplete file.
5. Download part1.sudo and part2.sudo and combine all the three files to form a jpg file `cat part1.sudo part2.sudo part3.sudo > flag.jpg`.

The jpg file has the flag
